This is the source code of paper : 'Bayesian Heuristics for Robust Spatial Perception' (chughtaiah@gmail.com) for point cloud registration. 
The authors acknowledge the authors of 'RANSIC: Fast and Highly Robust Estimation for Rotation Search and Point Cloud Registration using Invariant Compatibility that inspired this code and the Environment routine and  Matt Jacobson, http://www.xorantech.com for the standard open-source horns.m function as the non-minimal solver.

We resort to the Python binding of C++ open-sourced by the authors https://github.com/david-m-rosen/SE-Sync.

Use the provided Results_PGO file in the C++ examples path of the SE-Sync file to generate resuts.

Plot the exported results using the provided Results Matlab code and generate files e.g. ResTable_CSAIL, ResTable_intel (we used this just to keep formatting of plots the same).
